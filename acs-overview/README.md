# Advanced Client-Side Overview

## Responsive Design

Using media queries in CSS to create responsive website starting with mobile and then working your way up to tablet and desktop layouts.

## Sass

It's CSS but more awesome. Once you see it, you'll never want to write plain CSS again! Sass is a "preprocessor" language which means it needs to be compiled (converted) back into regular boring CSS for the browser to understand. There are a few applications that can do this, and some with really neat features built in like a live refresh or a web server to test on your phone.

## jQuery

It's JavaScript but much easier to use. jQuery flattens out the differences in browser behaviours with JavaScript and lets you implement plugins by simply copy/pasting them from sources online. If you want image sliders, pop-up images, form calendars, easy animations and visual effects, jQuery does it best.

Try to Google search queries such as "best jQuery plugins", "jQuery sliders", etc.

## Geolocation

Using Google Maps to find out where the visitor is located and then using that data to present useful information to them. For example:

* Where the nearest store is
* Autofilling an order form with the closest pizza shop
* How to get to a location with directions

## LocalStorage

Save data on the users browser that may be useful to them again in the future. For example:

* Save a form to continue filling it out later
* Save data from one page to be carried over to the next
* Saving the state of a game. Life points, high score, inventory items etc

## Canvas / SVG

Using HTML5 Canvas and SVG to draw graphics. Not with PhotoShop or Illustrator (defeats the point). Canvas is good for frame-by-frame animations whereas SVG is good for scalable / interactive linework.

## Client-Side Frameworks

Sometimes writing HTML and CSS from scratch takes ages just to get something basic up and running. What if you want to have something *now*! Frameworks such as [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) provide you a robust grid system with a few extra bits and pieces to make web development (and prototyping) *much* faster.

**These frameworks must NOT be used for this assignment**

## Mobile app development

You can use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create apps for phones, tablets and desktop computers! All you need is a tool called [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) (or one of its forks such as PhoneGap and Ionic) and you're ready to start making apps!

## Video and Audio

HTML5 brings native video and audio elements to the browser so you don't have to download Flash or Media Player extensions. You can use their built in controls, or design your own!
